# MNIST-project

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. I created a nueral network which helps the computer identify which piece od clothing is it 

This is project based on python which used these libraries: TensorFlow, os and numpy. 
1)This code first loads the data from the dataset and load the training set. 
2)We reshape the images, then create a callback function to stop the training once we reach 99.5% accuracy.
3)Create a convolutional_model
4)Train the model. 
5)Test the model.
